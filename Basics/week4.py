# 9.6. Cloning Lists
# If we want to modify a list and also keep a copy of the original, we need to be able to make a copy of the list itself,

# The easiest way to clone a list is to use the slice operator.

    score = person[1]

# The string method format, makes substitutions into places in a string enclosed in braces
person = input('Your name: ')
greeting = 'Hello {}!'.format(person)
print(greeting)
# a more concise version:
person = input('Enter your name: ')
print('Hello {}!'.format(person))

#...There can be multiple substitutions, with data of any type. Next we use floats.
# Try original price $2.50 with a 7% discount:
origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
calculation = '${} discounted by {}% is ${}.'.format(origPrice, discount, newPrice)
print(calculation)

# Format strings can give further information inside the braces showing how to specially format data.
# For two decimal places, put :.2f inside the braces for the monetary values:
origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
calculation = '${:.2f} discounted by {}% is ${:.2f}.'.format(origPrice, discount, newPrice)
print(calculation)

"""
A technical point: Since braces have special meaning in a format string, 
there must be a special rule if you want braces to actually be included in the final formatted string. 
The rule is to double the braces: \{\{ and \}\}.
"""
# For example mathematical set notation uses braces.
# The initial and final doubled braces in the format string below generate literal braces in the formatted string:
a = 5
b = 9
setStr = 'The set is \{\{\{}, {}}}.'.format(a, b)

print(accum)
"""
Note: in the example above, we could have written: 
    accum = accum + [x], or 
    accum += [x]. 
In either case, we’d need to concatenate a list containing x, not just x itself.

To see this more easily, try walking through this code in codelens.
