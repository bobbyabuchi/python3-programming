- Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous:
nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
- Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
- And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
- Follow peace with all men, and holiness (treat all men with love & respect), without which no man shall see the Lord:
Hebrews 12:11-14 @Ecclus.12**1->4/||@|
