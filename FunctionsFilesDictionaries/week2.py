"""
Dictionaries and Dictionary Accumulation
new data type, dictionaries. You will be introduced to the mechanics of dictionaries
and then get practice using them in accumulation patterns, both to build a dictionary using the pattern
as well as find the best, or worst, result using the pattern.

"""
One other nice thing about using a dictionary is that we don’t have to prespecify what all the letters will be. 
In this case, we know in advance what the alphabet for English is, but later in the chapter we will count the 
occurrences of words, and we do not know in advance all the of the words that may be used. 
Rather than pre-specifying which letters to keep accumulator counts for, we can start with an empty dictionary
and add a counter to the dictionary each time we encounter a new thing that we want to start keeping count of.
