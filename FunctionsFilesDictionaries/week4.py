"""
More Iteration and Advanced Functions
more advanced iteration mechanism, the while loop. You will be introduced to using it when getting feedback from users,
as well as applying it to the turtle module to draw images. Additionally, you will also be exposed to more advanced function concepts
such as the idea of parameters being optional, not required, and anonymous functions using lambda.

# 14.5. Break and Continue

# immediately “continue” with the next iteration. The program will skip the rest of the iteration, recheck
# the condition, and maybe does another iteration depending on the condition set for the while loop.

# 4.7.2. Keyword Arguments
# Functions can also be called using keyword arguments of the form kwarg=value. For instance, the following function:

    print("-- This parrot wouldn't", action, end=' ')
    print("if you put", voltage, "volts through it.")
    print("-- Lovely plumage, the", type)

# accepts one required argument (voltage) and three optional arguments (state, action, and type).
# This function can be called in any of the following ways:
parrot(1000)                                          # 1 positional argument
parrot(voltage=1000)                                  # 1 keyword argument
parrot(voltage=1000000, action='VOOOOOM')             # 2 keyword arguments
parrot(action='VOOOOOM', voltage=1000000)             # 2 keyword arguments
parrot('a million', 'bereft of life', 'jump')         # 3 positional arguments
parrot('a thousand', state='pushing up the daisies')  # 1 positional, 1 keyword

# Sometimes, you may want to use the .format method to insert the same value into a string multiple times.
# You can do this by simply passing the same string into the format method, assuming you have included {} s in the string
# everywhere you want to interpolate them. But you can also use positional passing references to do this!
# The order in which you pass arguments into the format method matters: the first one is argument 0,
# the second is argument 1, and so on.
#
# For example,
# this works
names = ["Jack","Jill","Mary"]
