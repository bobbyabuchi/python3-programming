"""
Functions and Tuples
In week three you will be introduced to the construction of functions.
write your own functions, including how to define a function, how to incorporate parameters,
how to return data from a function, the local or global scope of variables, and potential side effects that could occur from function execution.
Finally, we look at tuples more in depth, and how automatic packing and unpacking of tuples can be used in functions and in for loops.
"""
# Default Parameter Value : The following example shows how to use a default parameter value.
# If we call the function without argument, it uses the default value:
def nationality(country = "Black", ZipCode = 'Enter Zipcode'):
  print("I am from " + country, ZipCode)
nationality("Sweden")
nationality("India")
nationality('Israel')
nationality("Brazil", 270)
nationality()

# 13.3. Tuple Assignment with Unpacking

# unpacking tuple of values into the variable names.
# This does the equivalent of seven assignment statements, all on one easy line.
julia = "Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia"
name, surname, birth_year, movie, movie_year, profession, birth_place = julia
# Naturally, the number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right have to be the same.
name = julia[0]
surname = julia[1]
print(name,surname)

# Unpacking into multiple variable names also works with lists, or any other sequence type,
# as long as there is exactly one value for each variable. For example, you can write x, y = [3, 4]

# 13.3.1. Swapping Values between Variables
a = 1
b = 2
temp = a # temp1
a = b # a2
b = temp # b1
print(a, b, temp) # 2,1,1

# Tuple assignment solves this problem neatly:
a = 1
b = 2
(a, b) = (b, a)
print(a, b) # 2,1

# The left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of values. Each value is assigned to its
# respective variable. All the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any of the assignments.
# This feature makes tuple assignment quite versatile

# 13.3.2. Unpacking Into Iterator Variables

# Multiple assignment with unpacking is particularly useful when you iterate through a list of tuples.
# You can unpack each tuple into several loop variables. For example:
authors = [('Paul', 'Resnick'), ('Brad', 'Miller'), ('Lauren', 'Murphy'), ('Bobby', 'Abuchi')]
for first_name, last_name in authors:
    print("first name:", first_name, "last name:", last_name)

# On the first iteration the tuple ('Paul', 'Resnick') is unpacked into the two variables first_name and last_name.
# On the second iteration, the next tuple is unpacked into those same loop variables.

# 13.3.3. The Pythonic Way to Enumerate Items in a Sequence

#  iterating through the indexes of a sequence, and thus enumerate the items and their positions in the sequence

# Python provides a built-in function enumerate. It takes a sequence as input and returns a sequence of tuples.
# In each tuple, the first element is an integer and the second is an item from the original sequence.
# (It actually produces an “iterable” rather than a list, but we can use it in a for loop as the sequence
# to iterate over.)

# more pythonic approach to enumerating items in a sequence.
fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'peach']
for item in enumerate(fruits):

# If you remember, the .items() dictionary method produces a sequence of tuples. Keeping this in mind,
# we have provided you a dictionary called pokemon. For every key value pair, append the key to the list p_names,
# and append the value to the list p_number. Do not use the .keys() or .values() methods.

# The .items() method produces a sequence of key-value pair tuples. With this in mind, write code to create a list
# of keys from the dictionary track_medal_counts and assign the list to the variable name track_events.
# Do NOT use the .keys() method.

# 13.4. Tuples as Return Values

# Functions can return tuples as return values. This is very useful — we often want to know some batsman’s highest
# and lowest score, or we want to find the mean and the standard deviation, or we want to know the year, the month,
# and the day, or if we’re doing some ecological modeling we may want to know the number of rabbits and the number
# of wolves on an island at a given time. In each case, a function (which can only return a single value),
# can create a single tuple holding multiple elements.

# For example, here is a function that returns both the area and the circumference of a circle of radius r.
def circleInfo(r):
    """ Return (circumference, area) of a circle of radius r """
    c = 2 * 3.14159 * r         # 2Pr
    a = 3.14159 * r * r         # Pr2
    return (c, a)

print(circleInfo(10))

# Again, we can take advantage of packing to make the code look a little more readable on line 5
def circleInfo(r):
    """ Return (circumference, area) of a circle of radius r """
    c = 2 * 3.14159 * r
    a = 3.14159 * r * r
    return c, a
print(circleInfo(int(input('Enter radius: '))))

# It’s common to unpack the returned values into multiple variables.
def circleInfo(r):
    """ Return (circumference, area) of a circle of radius r """
    c = 2 * 3.14159 * r
    a = 3.14159 * r * r
    return c, a

# 13.5. Unpacking Tuples as Arguments to Function Calls

# Python even provides a way to pass a single tuple to a function and have it be unpacked for assignment
# to the named parameters.

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print(add(3, 4))
z = (5, 4)
print(add(z)) # this line causes an error

# This won’t quite work. It will cause an error, because the function add is expecting two parameters,
# but you’re only passing one parameter (a tuple). If only there was a way to tell python to unpack
# that tuple and use the first element to assign to x and the second to y.
#
# Actually, there is a way.

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print(add(3, 4))
z = (5, 4)
print(add(*z)) # this line will cause the values to be unpacked

# 13.6. Glossary
# tuple
# A type of sequence, much like a list but immutable. A tuple is created by enclosing one or more values in
# parentheses, separated by commas.
#
# packing
# When multiple values are specified, separated by commas, they are packed into a tuple.
#
# unpacking
# When a tuple is assigned to a collection of variable names separated by commas, the tuple is unpacked and
# the separate values are assigned to each of the variables.
#
# pair
# A tuple with exactly two items.

# Given is the dictionary, gold, which shows the country and the number of gold medals they have earned so far in
# the 2016 Olympics. Create a list, num_medals, that contains only the number of medals for each country.
# You must use the .items() method. Note: The .items() method provides a list of tuples. Do not use .keys() method.
