# sort method returns the value None. But modifies/mutates the original list itself
# This kind of operation that works by having a side effect on the list can be quite confusing.

# sorted does not change the original list. Instead, it returns a new list.

# The sorted function takes some optional parameters (see the Optional Parameters page). The first optional parameter is a key function, which will be described in the next section. The second optional parameter is a Boolean value which determines whether to sort the items in reverse order. By default, it is False, but if you set it to True, the list will be sorted in reverse order.

# 16.3. Optional key parameter

# For example, suppose you want to sort a list of numbers based on their absolute value, so that -4 comes after 3?

# Now, we can pass the absolute function to sorted in order to specify that we want the items sorted in order of their absolute value, rather than in order of their actual value.

# Note that this code never explicitly calls the absolute function at all. It passes the absolute function as a parameter value to the sorted function. Inside the sorted function, whose code we haven’t seen, that function gets invoked.

# Note
#
# It is a little confusing that we are reusing the word key so many times. The name of the optional parameter is 'key'. We will usually pass a parameter value using the keyword parameter passing mechanism. When we write 'key=some_function' in the function invocation, the word key is there because it is the name of the parameter, specified in the definition of the sort function, not because we are using keyword-based parameter passing.

#  You will be sorting the following list by each element’s second letter, a to z. Create a function to use when
#  sorting, called second_let. It will take a string as input and return the second letter of that string.
#  Then sort the list, create a variable called sorted_by_second_let and assign the sorted list to it. Do not use lambda.

"""
With a dictionary that’s maintaining counts or some other kind of score, we might prefer to get the outputs sorted 
based on the count rather than based on the items. The standard way to do that in python is to sort based on a 
property of the key, in particular its value in the dictionary. Here things get a little confusing because we have 
two different meaning of the word “key”. One meaning is a key in a dictionary. The other meaning is the parameter 
name for the function that you pass into the sorted function. Remember that the key function always takes as input 
one item from the sequence and returns a property of the item. In our case, the items to be sorted are the 
dictionary’s keys, so each item is one key from the dictionary. To remind ourselves of that, we’ve named 
the parameter in tha lambda expression k. The property of key k that is supposed to be returned is its associated 
value in the dictionary. Hence, we have the lambda expression lambda k: d[k].

# of the fact that when you pass a dictionary to something that is expecting a list, its the same as passing the
# list of keys.

# Eventually, you will be able to read code like that and immediately know what it’s doing. For now, when you come
# across something confusing, like line 11, try breaking it down. The function sorted is invoked. Its first parameter
# value is a dictionary, which really means the keys of the dictionary. The second parameter, the key function,
# decorates the dictionary key with a post-it note containing that key’s value in dictionary d. The last parameter,
# True, says to sort in reverse order.
#
# There is another way to sort dictionaries, by calling .items() to extract a sequence of (key, value) tuples, and
# then sorting that sequence of tuples. But it’s better to learn the pythonic way of doing it, sorting the
# dictionary keys using a key function that takes one key as input and looks up the value in the dictionary.

negative, and all negative numbers to positive. As a result, the longest elements would be first and the shortest

# 16.6. 👩‍💻 When to use a Lambda Expression
"""
Though you can often use a lambda expression or a named function interchangeably when sorting, it’s generally best 
to use lambda expressions until the process is too complicated, and then a function should be used. For example, 
in the following examples, we’ll be sorting a dictionary’s keys by properties of its values. Each key is a state 
name and each value is a list of city names.
- For our first sort order, we want to sort the states in order by the length of the first city name. Here, it’s pretty 
easy to compute that property. states[state] is the list of cities associated with a particular state. So If state 
is a list of city strings, len(states[state][0]) is the length of the first city name. Thus, we can use a 
lambda expression:
"""
states = {"Minnesota": ["St. Paul", "Minneapolis", "Saint Cloud", "Stillwater"],
          "Michigan": ["Ann Arbor", "Traverse City", "Lansing", "Kalamazoo"],
          "Washington": ["Seattle", "Tacoma", "Olympia", "Vancouver"]}

print(sorted(states, key=lambda state: len(states[state][0])))

"""
That’s already pushing the limits of complex a lambda expression can be before it’s reall hard to read (or debug).

- For our second sort order, the property we want to sort by is the number of cities that begin with the letter ‘S’. 
The function defining this property is harder to express, requiring a filter and count accumulation pattern. 
So we are better off defining a separate, named function. Here, we’ve chosen to make a lambda expression that looks 
up the value associated with the particular state and pass that value to the named function s_cities_count. 
We could have passed just the key, but then the function would have to look up the value, and it would be a little 
confusing, from the code, to figure out what dictionary the key is supposed to be looked up in. Here, 
we’ve done the lookup right in the lambda expression, which makes it a little bit clearer that we’re just sorting 
the keys of the states dictionary based on a property of their values. It also makes it easier to reuse the 
counting function on other city lists, even if they aren’t embedded in that particular states dictionary.
"""
def s_cities_count(city_list):
    ct = 0
    for city in city_list:
        if city[0] == "S":
            ct += 1
