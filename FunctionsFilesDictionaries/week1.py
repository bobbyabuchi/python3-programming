# 10.4. Iterating over lines in a file

"""
To process all of our olypmics data, we will use a for loop to iterate over the lines of the file. 
Using the split method, we can break each line into a list containing all the fields of interest about the athlete. 
We can then take the values corresponding to name, team and event to construct a simple sentence.

"""
To make the code a little simpler, and to allow for more efficient processing, Python provides a built-in way to iterate through the contents
of a file one line at a time, without first reading them all into a list. Some students find this confusing initially, so we don’t recommend
doing it this way, until you get a little more comfortable with Python. But this idiom is preferred by Python programmers, so you should be
prepared to read it. And when you start dealing with big files, you may notice the efficiency gains of using it.
"""
olympicsfile = open("I:/pydata/olympics.txt", "r")

for aline in olympicsfile:
    values = aline.split(",")
    print(values[0], "is from", values[3], "and is on the roster for", values[4])

olympicsfile.close()

# 0.6. Using with for Files

md = open('mydata.txt', 'r')
for line in md:
    print(line)
md.close()

# can be written as

# so it closes the file automatically.
with open('I:/pydata/csvPhonebook.txt', 'r') as nnaa:
    for line in nnaa:
        print(line)


# 10.7. Recipe for Reading and Processing a File
"""
#1. Open the file using with and open.

#2. Use .readlines() to get a list of the lines of text in the file.

#3. Use a for loop to iterate through the strings in the list, each being one line from the file. 
On each iteration, process that line of text

#4. When you are done extracting data from the file, continue writing your code outside of the indentation. 
Using with will automatically close the file once the program exits the with block.
"""
# Example:
fname = "yourfile.txt"
with open(fname, 'r') as fileref:         # step 1
    lines = fileref.readlines()           # step 2
    for lin in lines:                     # step 3
        #some code that references the variable lin
#some other code not relying on fileref   # step 4

"""
However, this will not be good to use when you are working with large data. 
Imagine working with a datafile that has 1000 rows of data. It would take a long time to read in all the data 
and then if you had to iterate over it, even more time would be necessary. 
This would be a case where programmers prefer another option for efficiency reasons.
"""
# This option involves iterating over the file itself while still iterating over each line in the file:
fname = "yourfile.txt"
with open(fname, 'r') as fileref:         # step 1
    for lin in fileref:                   # step 2
        ## some code that reference the variable lin
#some other code not relying on fileref   # step 3

# 10.11. Writing data to a CSV File

"""
The typical pattern for writing data to a CSV file will be to write a header row and loop through the items in a list, 
outputting one row for each. Here we a have a list of tuples, each representing one Olympian, 
a subset of the rows and columns from the file we have been reading from.
