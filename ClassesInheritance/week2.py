# 22.1. Introduction: Class Inheritance

'''
Consider our Tamagotchi game. Suppose we wanted to make some different kinds of pets that have the same structure as
other pets, but have some different attributes or behave a little differently. For example, suppose that dog pets
should show their emotional state a little differently than cats or act differently when they are hungry or when they
are asked to fetch something.

You could implement this by making an instance variable for the pet type and dispatching on that instance variable in
various methods.

# 22.2. Inheriting Variables and Methods

'''
Inheritance provides us with an easy and elegant way to represent these differences. 
In the definition of the inherited class, you only need to specify the methods and instance variables that are 
different from the parent class (the parent class, or the superclass, is what we may call the class that is inherited 
from.

Here is an example. Say we want to define a class Cat that inherits from Pet. Assume we have the Pet class that we 
defined earlier.

We want the Cat type to be exactly the same as Pet, except we want the sound cats to start out knowing “meow” instead 
of “mrrp”, and we want the Cat class to have its own special method called chasing_rats, which only Cat s have.

We do that by putting the word Pet in parentheses, class Cat(Pet):
'''
#------------- refer to the code above------------------------------append this to it.......
p1 = Pet("Fido")
print(p1) # we've seen this stuff before!

p1.feed()
p1.hi()
print(p1)

cat1 = Cat("Fluffy")
print(cat1) # this uses the same __str__ method as the Pets do

cat1.feed() # Totally fine, because the cat class inherits from the Pet class!
cat1.hi()
print(cat1)

print(cat1.chasing_rats())

#print(p1.chasing_rats()) # This line will give us an error. The Pet class doesn't have this method!

'''
And you can continue the inheritance tree. We inherited Cat from Pet. Now say we want a subclass of Cat called 
Cheshire. A Cheshire cat should inherit everything from Cat, which means it inherits everything that Cat inherits 
from Pet, too. But the Cheshire class has its own special method, smile.
'''

class Cheshire(Cat): # this inherits from Cat, which inherits from Pet

    def smile(self): # this method is specific to instances of Cheshire
        print(":D :D :D")

# Let's try it with instances.
cat1 = Cat("Fluffy")
cat1.feed() # Totally fine, because the cat class inherits from the Pet class!
cat1.hi() # Uses the special Cat hello.
print(cat1)

print(cat1.chasing_rats())

new_cat = Cheshire("Pumpkin") # create a Cheshire cat instance with name "Pumpkin"
new_cat.hi() # same as Cat!
new_cat.chasing_rats() # OK, because Cheshire inherits from Cat
new_cat.smile() # Only for Cheshire instances (and any classes that you make inherit from Cheshire)

# cat1.smile() # This line would give you an error, because the Cat class does not have this method!

# None of the subclass methods can be used on the parent class, though.
p1 = Pet("Teddy")
p1.hi() # just the regular Pet hello
#p1.chasing_rats() # This will give you an error -- this method doesn't exist on instances of the Pet class.
#p1.smile() # This will give you an error, too. This method does not exist on instances of the Pet class.

another_cat = Siamese("Lady")
another_cat.song()

# Q4
'''
Along with the Pokemon parent class, we have also provided several subclasses. Write another method in the parent class that will be inherited by the subclasses. Call it opponent. It should return which type of pokemon the current type is weak and strong against, as a tuple.

Grass is weak against Fire and strong against Water

Ghost is weak against Dark and strong against Psychic

Fire is weak against Water and strong against Grass

Flying is weak against Electric and strong against Fighting

For example, if the p_type of the subclass is 'Grass', .opponent() should return the tuple ('Fire', 'Water')
