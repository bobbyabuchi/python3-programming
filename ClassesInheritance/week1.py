"""
Most programmers choose whether to make functions be stand-alone or methods of a class based on whether the function 
semantically seems to be an operation that is performed on instances of the class. In this case, because distance is 
really a property of a pair of points and is symmetric (the distance from a to b is the same as that from b to a) it 
makes more sense to have it be a standalone function and not a method. Many heated (heated? lol) discussions have 
occurred between programmers about such style decisions.
