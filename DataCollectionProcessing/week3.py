# 24.8.2. Defining a function to make repeated invocations
'''
Suppose you were writing a computer program that was going to automatically translate paragraphs of text into 
paragraphs with similar meanings but with more rhymes. You would want to contact the datamuse API repeatedly, 
passing different values associated with the key rel_rhy. Let’s make a python function to do that. 
You can think of it as a wrapper for the call to requests.get.
'''
# import statements for necessary Python modules
import requests

def get_rhymes(word):
    baseurl = "https://api.datamuse.com/words"
    params_diction = {} # Set up an empty dictionary for query parameters
    params_diction["rel_rhy"] = word
    params_diction["max"] = "3" # get at most 3 results
    resp = requests.get(baseurl, params=params_diction)
    # return the top three words
    word_ds = resp.json()
    return [d['word'] for d in word_ds]
    #return resp.json() # Return a python object (a list of dictionaries in this case)
print(get_rhymes("funny"))
print(get_rhymes("dash"))

# Challenge: try using the datamuse API to actually make a paragraph translator!

# requests-8-1: Why would you define a function in order to make a request to a REST API for data?
# -> Because that means you have to write less repeated code if you want to make a request to the same API more than
#     once in the same program.
# -> Writing functions to complete a complex process in your code makes it easier to read and easier to fix later.
# -> Because a lot of things stay the same among different requests to the same API.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# requests-8-1: If the results you are getting back from a call to requests.get() are not what you expected,
# what’s the first thing you should do?
# -> look at the first few characters of the .text attribute of the Response object

# requests-8-2: In a full python environment, if there is a runtime error and you don’t get a Response object back
# from the call to requests.get(), what should you do?
# -> invoke the requestURL() function with the same parameters you used to invoke requests.get()

# requests-8-3: In the runestone environment, if there is a runtime error and you don’t get a Response object back from
# the call to requests.get(), what should you do?
# -> look at the values you passed in to requests.get()
'''
Generally, a runtime error when you invoke ``requests.get`` in the Runestone environment is caused by the value of the
 ``params`` parameter not being a dictionary, or not having only strings as keys and values.
