# 23.1. Introduction: Map, Filter, List Comprehensions, and Zip
'''
Like in the accumulator pattern, We have frequently taken a list and produced another list from it that contains
either a subset of the items or a transformed version of each item
 -> When each item is transformed we say that the operation is a mapping, or just a map of the original list.
 -> When some items are omitted, we call it a filter.
 -> Python provides a new syntax, called list comprehensions, that lets you express a mapping and/or filtering
operation. Both map and filter are built-in functions in Python.
'''
# Map, and filter are commands that you would use in high-performance computing on big datasets.

# 23.2. Map

'''
Python map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)
Syntax: ->  map(fun, iter)
'''


# The following function produces a new list with each item in the original list doubled.
# It is an example of a mapping,
# from the original list to a new list of the same length, where each element is doubled.
def doubleStuff(a_list):
    """ Return a new list in which contains doubles of the elements in a_list. """
    new_list = []
    for value in a_list:
        new_elem = 2 * value
        new_list.append(new_elem)
    return new_list

things = [2, 5, 9]
print(things)
things = doubleStuff(things)
print(things)

'''
The doubleStuff function is an example of the accumulator pattern, in particular the mapping pattern. On line 3, 
new_list is initialized. On line 5, the doubled value for the current item is produced and on line 6 it is appended 
to the list we’re accumulating. Line 7 executes after we’ve processed all the items in the original list: 
it returns the new_list.
'''
# As we did when passing a function as a parameter to the sorted function, we can specify a function to pass to map
# either by referring to a function by name, or by providing a lambda expressi
def triple(a):
    return 3*a

# tripleStuff and quadStuff.
L = [2, 5, 9, 10]

Lx4 = map((lambda value: 4*value), L)
print(list(Lx4))

# 1. Using map, create a list assigned to the variable greeting_doubled that doubles each element in the list lst.
lst = [["hi", "bye"], "hello", "goodbye", [9, 2], 4]

greeting_doubled = map((lambda x: 2*x), lst)
print(list(greeting_doubled))

# 2. Below, we have provided a list of strings called abbrevs. Use map to produce a new list called abbrevs_upper
# that contains all the same strings in upper case.
abbrevs = ["usa", "esp", "chn", "jpn", "mex", "can", "rus", "rsa", "jam"]

abbrevs_upper = map((lambda x: x.upper()), abbrevs)

print(keep_evens([3, 4, 6, 7, 0, 1]))

# the filter function takes two arguments, a function and a sequence. The function takes one item and return True
# if the item should. It is automatically called for each item in the sequence. You don’t have to initialize an accumulator or iterate with a for loop.
def get_evens(n):
    v = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, n)
    return list(v)

print(get_evens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))

#  Write code to assign to the variable filter_testing all the elements in lst_check that have a w in them using filter.
lst_check = ['plums', 'watermelon', 'kiwi', 'strawberries', 'blueberries', 'peaches', 'apples', 'mangos', 'papaya']

def check_w(lst):
    myV = []
    for a in lst:
        if 'w' in a:
            myV.append(a)
    return list(myV)
filter_testing  = filter(check_w, lst_check)
print(check_w(lst_check))

# 2. Using filter, filter lst so that it only contains words containing the letter “o”. Assign to variable lst2.
lst = ["witch", "halloween", "pumpkin", "cat", "candy", "wagon", "moon"]

def check_o(lst):
    myV = []
    for a in lst:

            myV.append(a)
    return list(myV)
lst2  = filter(check_o, lst)
print(lst2)

# 23.4. List Comprehensions
# Python's alternative way to do map and filter operations.

# List comprehensions are concise ways to create lists from other lists. The general syntax is:
# [<transformer_expression> for <loop_var> in <sequence> if <filtration_expression>]

# where the if clause is optional. For example
things = [2, 5, 9]
yourlist = [value * 2 for value in things]
print(yourlist)
# where the transformer expression is -> value * 2
# item variable is -> value
# sequence is -> things
'''
As with map, each item in the sequence is transformed into an item in the new list. Instead of the iteration happening 
automatically, however, we have adopted the syntax of the for loop which may make it easier to understand.

Just as in a regular for loop, the part of the statement for value in things says to execute some code once for each 
item in things. Each time that code is executed, value is bound to one item from things. The code that is executed 
each time is the transformer expression, value * 2, rather than a block of code indented underneath the for statement. 
The other difference from a regular for loop is that each time the expression is evaluated, the resulting value is 
appended to a list. That happens automatically, without the programmer explicitly initializing an empty list or 
appending each item.
'''

# The if clause of a list comprehension can be used to do a filter operation.
# To perform a pure filter operation, the expression can be simply the variable that is bound to each item.
# For example, the following list comprehension will keep only the even numbers from the original list.
def keep_evens(nums):
    new_list = [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0]
    return new_list
print(keep_evens([3, 4, 6, 7, 0, 1]))

# combining map and filter operations (by chaining them together, or with a single list comprehension).
things = [3, 4, 6, 7, 0, 1]
#chaining together filter and map:
# first, filter to keep only the even numbers
# double each of them
print(map(lambda x: x*2, filter(lambda y: y % 2 == 0, things)))

# equivalent version using list comprehension
print([x*2 for x in things if x % 2 == 0])

# AdAccum-4-1: What is printed by the following statements?
alist = [4,2,8,6,5]
blist = [num*2 for num in alist if num%2==1] # will check for odd num first then double
print(blist) #  5 is the only odd number in alist. It is doubled before being placed in blist.

# 2. The for loop below produces a list of numbers greater than 10. Below the given code, use list comprehension to
# accomplish the same thing. Assign it the the variable lst2. Only one line of code is needed.
L = [12, 34, 21, 4, 6, 9, 42]
